--------- Original GoF Patterns ----------



Flyweight Pattern.
Output is a flyweight factory.
CONSOLE is a flyweight object (declared public-static-final).
File location: cassandra-trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/tools/Output.java

Template Method Found.
WrappedRunnable is the template class
run is the template method
runMayThrow is a primitive method
File Location: cassandra-trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/utils/WrappedRunnable.java

Factory Method pattern.
INodeProbeFactory is a Factory Method class.
InternalNodeProbeFactory is a concrete Factory Method class.
create is a factory method returns  InternalNodeProbe
 which extends NodeProbe
File Location: cassandra-trunk/test/distributed/org/apache/cassandra/distributed/mock/nodetool/InternalNodeProbeFactory.java

Factory Method pattern.
INodeProbeFactory is a Factory Method class.
InternalNodeProbeFactory is a concrete Factory Method class.
create is a factory method returns  InternalNodeProbe
 which extends NodeProbe
